# Rimworld Backstory Database
The rimworld Backstory Database mod aims to bring the old Backstory Database back into the 1.4 build of the game kicking and screaming. And aims to provide a unified database for mod authors to use.

If you're a mod author, usage of this mod should be simple, simply reference the assembly and make your mod a dependency. Rimworld Backstory Database *should* load all the old defenitions like normal.

Note, this mod is very experimental and any updates are apriciated. This mod simply aims to make the porting process to 1.4 as painless as possible and is ***NOT*** Backwards compatible with earlier versions of rimworld.
